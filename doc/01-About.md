# Icinga Web Performance Data Graphs

Icinga Web Module for Performance Data Graphs. This module enables graphs on the Host and Service Detail View for
the respective performance data.

The actual data is fetched by a "backend module", this module and at least one backend module need to be enabled.

## Features

* Interactive graphs for Host and Service performance data
  * Mouse click and select a region to zoom in
  * Click on a time range or double click to zoom out
* Graphs are adjustable via Icinga 2 custom variables
* Interchangeable performance data backends
  * Fetched data is cached to improve speed and reduce load on the backend

## Design Decisions

Here are some of our design decisions in order to understand why the module works the way it does.
This should also be used as a reference for future development.

This module aims to be a "batteries included" and opinionated solution.
Configuration options are limited by design.

### Data in PHP and charts in JavaScript

All data processing will be done in PHP and the data is then handed over to JavaScript for rendering.

We decided to use JavaScript client-side rendering because it offered simple interactivity (e.g. zoom).
In the initial phase we saw that canvas-based rendering offered better performance than AVG when there is
a large amount of datapoints.

[uPlot](https://github.com/leeoniya/uPlot) was chosen for its minimalism and focus on time series.

Initially, JavaScript fetched the all data as JSON via a PHP controller and then rendered the individual charts.
This had the benefit of client-side caching. However, this had some drawbacks. First, all JSON data had to be prepared as a whole, which caused memory issued with PHP. Second, since the amount of elements the page was not known before rendering it caused issues with the collapsible feature.

Currently we add an DOM element for each chart and attach its datapoints as a data attribute.
The JavaScript part of the module simply iterates over the elements, extracts the data attribute and renders the chart.
This solves some of the initial drawbacks, however, it also comes with its own issues.

None of this is set in stone and might change should other implementations offer a better solution.
If you have ideas for improvements, let us know!

### A chart for each metric

There is a separate chart for each metric because the magnitude of performance data for a single check plugin
can vary widely. Meaning one metric could be double digits and another only fractions.
Custom configuration for when metrics should be combined in a single chart would highly
increase the complexity of this module.

An option to manually merge metrics into one chart could be added in the future.

### Gaps when there is no data

If there is missing data, the chart will show gaps and will not connect the data points to avoid misinterpretation.
Changes in a check interval are automatically accounted for.

### Custom variables

We decided to use custom variables for graph configuration.
This avoids having another database for configuration and should integrate well with existing
Icinga configuration management tools.

In order to ease integration with the Icinga Director, in which Icinga 2 dictionary data types are currently
no the easiest to work with, we decided to use "flat" data types where possible (e.g. `perfdatagraphs_config_disable`).

However, for the `perfdatagraphs_metrics` variable a dictionary is the natural fit and "flat" data types
would have increased the complexity of the code base. Thus, we decided to use dictionaries.

### Y-axis units

Too high or low values for the y-axis are automatically transformed into exponential notation,
otherwise the width of the axis would grow endlessly.

Custom formats can be invoked by using `unit` for a metric:

```
vars.perfdatagraphs_metrics["disk"] = {
  unit = "bytes"
}
```

The configuration documentation shows all available units.
